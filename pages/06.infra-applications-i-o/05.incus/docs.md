Incus is fork of Canonical LXD. [Proxmox](/proxmox) is mainly used to run and manage [LXC containers](/lxc)

Incus was tested if it could replace [Proxmox](/proxmox). Managing Incus containers with provided UI was not fluent , so I think Incus could be valid alternative after I have gained enough experience with [Ansible](/ansible).
