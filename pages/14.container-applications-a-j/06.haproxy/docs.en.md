[Traefik](/traefik) has replaced [HAProxy](/haproxy)

~~HAProxy is reverse proxy and load balancer. It has central role when [accessing applications](/access-to-applications)~~

~~Currently [HAproxy](/haproxy) is not utilized as load balancer as there is only single backends for each service. Still, [HAproxy](/haproxy) is validating health of backends regularly and reporting those in http://192.168...:8404/.~~

~~HAProxy can be accessed either through [Cloudflare](/cloudflare) tunnel or [local network](/lan). HAProxy has no open ports to public internet.~~
