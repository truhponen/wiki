Containers are set of software and dependencies stored in "container image".

Ready container images are available e.g. in 
* [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)
* [Github](/github)

Kotimme-architecture uses only ready images which are just [configured](/configurations) accordingly.
