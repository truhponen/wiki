Voice messages are available in [Home Assistant](/home-assistant) UI. User can type message and select [audio device](/audio-devices) that plays message.

Text message that is stored to Home Assistant's "text helper" is converted to speech by [Piper](/piper). Piper is integrated to [Home Assistant](/home-assistant) which plays the result in selected [audio device](/audio-devices).
