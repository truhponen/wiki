Zigbee router is physical device that extends [Zigbee coordinator's](/zigbee-coordinator) network.

Current Zigbee router is SONOFF ZB Dongle -E USB Dongle Plus. Aliexpress merchant had incorrect product information and when I ordered model P they shipped "model E". Eventually I got device for free and I flashed to be router.
