Cloudflare is used for DNS, certificates, Zero Trust access and SSH browser rendering. 

[Access to home network](/access-to-applications) goes through Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels which replaced earlier [Open VPN](/open-vpn) implementation. Cloudflare is used to manage users, login and device enrollment.
