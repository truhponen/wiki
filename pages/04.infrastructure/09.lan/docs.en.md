Our home's local area network consists:

* TP-link Deco mesh routers
* ZyXEL GS-105B and GS-108B v3 switches
* ZyXEL GS1200-8 switch

Deco mesh routers form backbone of local area network. Network is not wired as I'm lazy and all walls are thick concrete. Most of devices have wired connection to nearest deco through ZyXEL switches.

Currently only IPv4 network is enabled. This is due to [DHCP](/dhcp) configurations.
