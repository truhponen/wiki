Our home's local area network is build using [mesh routers](/routers) and [network switches](/network-switches)

[Mesh routers](/routers) form backbone of local area network. Network is not wired as I'm lazy and all walls are thick concrete. Most of devices have wired connection to nearest deco through [network switches](/network-switches).

Currently only IPv4 network is enabled. This is due to [DHCP](/dhcp) configurations.
