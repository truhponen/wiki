Incus is fork of Canonical LXD. [Proxmox](/proxmox) is mainly used to run and manage [LXC containers](/lxc) Incus was tested if it could replace [Proxmox](/proxmox). I might skip Incus all together and start using [Kubernetes](/kubernetes).

Managing containers with Incus was not as refined as with Proxmox, thereforce I think Incus could be valid alternative after I have automated most of LXC management with [Ansible](/ansible).
