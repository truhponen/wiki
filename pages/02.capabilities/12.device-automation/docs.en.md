Device automations are used to change parameters of systems automatically. Device automations are managed by [Home Assistant](/home-assistant).

Some examples:
* when sound source for [Musiccast](/musiccast) device is Spotify, sound settings is set to "Music"
* when bathroom [Musiccast](/musiccast) device is turned on, analog amplifier driving bathroom speakers is turned on.
